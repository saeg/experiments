Bug issue: #258
Description: When parsing, allow all tags to self-close. Tags that aren't expected to self-close will get an end tag.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault HTB_1 in the file HtmlTreeBuilder, see HtmlTreeBuilder.cpp. 
  The faulty lines are 148 and 151.
- Missing code and wrong method call.
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
