Bug issue: #109
Description: Fixed an issue with a missing quote when serialising DocumentType nodes.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault DT_1 in the file DocumentType, see DocumentType.cpp. The faulty lines are 35 and 40.
- The fault is a wrong value passed to a method call of a Java default library and missing code. 
- 13213 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java

- There is a total of 288 test cases, one of which fails, DocumentTypeTest.outerHtmlGeneration()
