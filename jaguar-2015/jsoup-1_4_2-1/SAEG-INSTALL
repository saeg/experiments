Bug issue: 
Description: Force strict entity matching (must be &xxx; and not &xxx) in element attributes.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault ET_1 in the file Entities, see Entities.cpp. The faulty line is 76.
- Missing code in an if condition.
- 8715 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java

- There is a total of 239 test cases, two of which fail
