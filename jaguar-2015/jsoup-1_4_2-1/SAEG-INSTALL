previous commit 277949e7115059f6f0071e1b3418b6f6cbf48e48

Bug issue: 
Description: Force strict entity matching (must be &xxx; and not &xxx) in element attributes.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault ET_1 in the file Entities, see Entities.cpp. The faulty line is 76.
- Missing code in an if condition.
- 8715 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 239 test cases, two of which fail


Git commands used to obtain the fault:
git clone https://github.com/michael-simons/jsoup.git
