Bug issue: #104
Description: Fixed an issue when parsing <script> tags.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault TBS_2 in the files TreeBuilderState, see TreeBuilderState.cpp. 
  The faulty line is 283.
- The fault is a missing parameter in a method call (missing code). 
- 13119 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 278 test cases, one of which fails - ParserTest.handlesDataOnlyTags().
