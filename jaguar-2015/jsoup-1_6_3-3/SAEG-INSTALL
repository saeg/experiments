previous commit dbc1e34bdeede1cabee58b65bceb02f930ce5d88

Bug issue: #145
Description: Fixed HTML entity parser to correctly parse entities like frac14 (letter + number combo).

Changes
- This version already contains the fault T_1 in the file Tokeniser, see Tokeniser.cpp. 
  The faulty line is 135.
- Wrong method called. There is the addition of a new method to complement the fixing ( CharacterReader.consumeLetterThenDigitSequence() ).
- This fault can also deemed a missing code in the method consumeLetterSequence(), line 115, which is fixed by CharacterReader.consumeLetterThenDigitSequence().
- 13968 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java

- There is a total of 326 test cases, one of which fails.
