previous commit 29c9d48278aafb4a4390e3ee923cd68e6086a17f

Bug issue: 
Description: Tweaked Element.outerHtml() method to not generate initial newline on first output element.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault E_2 in the file Element, see Element.cpp. The faulty line is 960.
- Missing code in an If statement
- 8847 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 250 test cases, five of which fail


Git commands used to obtain the fault:
git clone https://github.com/michael-simons/jsoup.git
