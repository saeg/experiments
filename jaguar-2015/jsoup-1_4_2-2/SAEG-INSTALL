Bug issue: #52
Description: Fixed issue when using descendant regex attribute selectors.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault S_1 in the file Selector, see Selector.cpp. The faulty line is 139.
- Wrong method call.
- 9748 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java

- There is a total of 297 test cases, one of which causes an error
