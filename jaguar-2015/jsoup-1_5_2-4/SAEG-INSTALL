Bug issue: 
Description: Allow <a> and <font> elements to be treated as flow/block elements, to match browser parse trees.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault T_2 in the file Tag, see Tag.cpp. The faulty line is 309.
- Missing code.
- There is another fault, but there is no interference between them in the test results.
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 248 test cases, one of which fails
