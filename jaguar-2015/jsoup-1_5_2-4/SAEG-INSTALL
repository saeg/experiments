Bug issue: 
Description: Allow <a> and <font> elements to be treated as flow/block elements, to match browser parse trees.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault T_2 in the file Tag, see Tag.cpp. The faulty line is 309.
- Missing code.
- There is another fault, but there is no interference between them in the test results.
- 8833 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing

- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java
