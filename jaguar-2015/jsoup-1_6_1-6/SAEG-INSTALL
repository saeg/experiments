Bug issue: #110
Description: Fixed normalisation of carriage returns to newlines on input HTML

Changes
- This version already contains the fault CR_3 in the file CharacterReader, see CharacterReader.cpp. 
  The faulty line is 99.
- The faults are related to the same issue, a missing code and a wrong value passed as parameter to a java library call.
-  With both bugs, three test cases fail. With CR_2, two tests fail. With CR_3, two tests fail.
- There are no interferences in the test results when the two bugs are present and one test fails in common for both 
  isolated faults.
- 13242 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 293 test cases, two of which fail with the two bugs.
