previous commit 0c10dbffb475febe05ebaf074278e5d5aa81e32c

Bug issue: #489
Description: Form data submission fix. Don’t submit disabled elements.
			 Set checkbox and radio to default val ‘on’ if unset.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault FE_1 in the file FileElement, see FileElement.cpp. 
  The faulty line is 80.
- Missing code.
- With both faults, two test cases fail, with FE_1 only one test fails, and with FE_2 both tests fail.
- Although the faults are related to the same fix, they solve different aspects of the domain 
  (radio button on html pages).
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 438 test cases, two of which fail.
