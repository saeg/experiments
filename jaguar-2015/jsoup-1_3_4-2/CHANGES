jsoup changelog

*** Release 1.3.4 [PENDING]
 * Fixed issue in jsoup.connect when extracting character set from content-type header; now supports quoted
   charset declaration.
   
 * Fixed support for jsoup.connect to follow redirects between http & https URLs.
   <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/37>

 * Implemented DataNode.setWholeData() to allow updating of script and style data contents.

 * Document normalisation now more correctly enforces document structure.

 * Support node.outerHtml() method when node has no parent.

 * Fixed support for HTML entities with numbers in name (e.g. &frac34, &sup1)

*** Release 1.3.3 [2010-Sep-19]
 * Implemented Elements.empty() and Elements.remove(). This allows easy element removal, like:
    doc.select("iframe").remove();
    
 * Fixed issue in Entities when unescaping &#36; ("$")
   <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/34>

 * Added restricted XHTML output entity option
   <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/35>

*** Release 1.3.2 [2010-Aug-30]
 * Treat HTTP headers as case insensitive in Jsoup.Connection. Improves compatibility for HTTP responses.

 * Improved malformed table parsing by implementing ignorable end tags.

*** Release 1.3.1 [2010-Aug-23]
 * Removed dependency on Apache Commons-lang. Jsoup now has no external dependencies.

 * Added new Connection implementation, to enable easier and richer HTTP requests that parse to Documents. This includes
   support for gzip responses, cookies, headers, data parameters, user-agent, referrer, etc.
  
 * Added Element.ownText() method, to get only the direct text of an element, not including the text of its children.
 
 * Added support for selectors :containsOwn(text) and :matchesOwn(regex), to supplement Element.ownText().

 * Added support for non-pretty-printed HTML output, to more closely mirror the input HTML.

 * Further speed optimisations for parsing and output generation.
 
 * Fixed support for case-sensitive HTML escape entities.
   <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/31>
 
 * Fixed issue when parsing tags with keyless attributes.
   <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/32>

*** Release 1.2.3 [2010-Aug-04]
 * Added support for automatic input character set detection and decoding. Jsoup now automatically detects the encoding
   character set when parsing HTML from a File or URL. The parser checks the content-type header, then the
   <meta http-equiv> or <meta charset> tag, and finally falls back to UTF-8.

 * Added ability to configure the document's output charset, to control which characters are HTML escaped, and which
   are kept intact. The output charset defaults to the document's input charset. This simplifies non-ascii output.

 * Added full support for all new HTML5 tags.

 * Added support for HTML5 dataset custom data attributes, with the Element.dataset() map.

 * Added support for the [^attributePrefix] selector query, to find elements with attributes starting with a prefix.
   Useful for finding elements with datasets: [^data-] matches <p data-name="jsoup">

 * Added support for namespaced elements (<fb:name>) and selectors to find them (fb|name)

 * Implemented Node.ownerDocument DOM method

 * Improved implicit table element handling (particularly around thead, tbody, and tfoot).

 * Improved HTML output format for empty elements and auto-detected self closing tags

 * Changed DT & DD tags to block-mode tags, to follow practice over spec

 * Added support for tag names with - and _ (<abc_foo>, <abc-foo>)

 * Handle tags with internal trailing space (<foo >)
 
 * Fixed support for character class regular expressions in [attr=~regex] selector

*** Release 1.2.2 [2010-Jul-11]
 
 * Performance optimisation:
    - core HTML parser engine now 3.5 times faster
    - HTML generator now 2.5 times faster
    - much lower memory use and garbage collection time
    
 * Added support for :matches(regex) selector, to find elements containing text matching regular expression
 
 * Added support for [key~=regex] attribute selector, to find elements with attribute values matching regular expression

 * Upgraded the selector query parser to allow nested selectors like 'div:has(p:matches(regex))'

*** Release 1.2.1 [2010-Jun-21]
 * Added .before(html) and .after(html) methods to Element and Elements, to insert sibling HTML
 
 * Added :contains(text) selector, to search for elements containing the specified text

 * Added :has(selector) pseudo-selector
     <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/20>

 * Added Element#parents and Elements#parents to retrieve an element's ancestor chain
     <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/20>

 * Fixes an issue where appending / prepending rows to a table (or  to similar implicit
    element structures) would create a redundant wrapping elements
       <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/21>

 * Improved implicit close tag heuristic detection when parsing malformed HTML

 * Fixes an issue where text content after a script (or other data-node) was
     incorrectly added to the data node.
       <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/22>

 * Fixes an issue where text order was incorrect when parsing pre-document
    HTML.

 	  <http://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/issue/13>
