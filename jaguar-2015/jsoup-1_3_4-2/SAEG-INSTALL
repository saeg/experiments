Bug issue: #46
Description: Fixed support for HTML entities with numbers in name (e.g. &frac34, &sup1).

Changes
- This version already contains the fault ET_1 in the file Entities, see Entities.cpp. The faulty line is 38.
- Wrong value assigned to a global variable.
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 227 test cases, one of which fails
