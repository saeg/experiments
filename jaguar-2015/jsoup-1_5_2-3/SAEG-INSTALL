Bug issue: 
Description: Updated Element.text() method to ensure <br> tags output as whitespace.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault E_3 in the file Element, see Element.cpp. The faulty lines are 729 and 730.
- Missing code.
- 8840 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 249 test cases, one of which fails ElementTest.testBrHasSpace()
