Bug issue: #305
Description: Fixed support for self-closing script tags.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault HTB_1 in the files HtmlTreeBuilder and HtmlBuilderTreeState, see HtmlTreeBuilder.cpp and HtmlBuilderTreeState.cpp. 
  The faulty lines are 162 in HtmlBuilderTree and 130 in HtmlBuilderTreeState.
- Missing code in HtmlBuilderTree and a method call in a wrong flow in HtmlBuilderTreeState. Both faulty lines generate the same failure.
- 13191 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4
- configure output folder properties for the source folders: {project_name}/target/classes for src/main/java and as the default output folder; and {project_name}/target/test-classes for src/test/java

- There is a total of 398 test cases, one of which fails.
