We named this version as v2.
- Three test classes which fail without the fault were excluded
--com.thoughtworks.acceptance.ClassLoaderTest (1 test case)
--com.thoughtworks.acceptance.XStreamTest (4 test cases)
--com.thoughtworks.xstream.core.utils.WeakCacheTest (1 test cases)
- This version already contains the fault JBC_AK_1 in the file JavaBeanConverter, see JavaBeanConverter.cpp. The fault line is 83.
- The fault is caused by Absense of code
- Only the sub-project xstream was included
- The junit-3.8.1.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml inside the folder xstream.
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 1643 test cases, one of which fails JavaBeanConverterTest.testRoundtripWithNullValue()
