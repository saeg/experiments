jsoup 1.6.1 - commit 128b3f8212e357468cb608546a52da3826903fad
previous commit 3d6f1e47ccf93d01364ed5f7603fa66d43eae0e2

Bug issue: #110
Description: Fixed normalisation of carriage returns to newlines on input HTML.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault CR_1 in the file CharacterReader, see CharacterReader.cpp. The faulty lines are 17, 18 and 99.
- There are two related faults in the class and the bugs interfere in the number of failures. 
  The fixes are related to the same problem. Missing code (constructor) and a wrong value passed 
  to a method call of a Java default library (method consumeToEnd()).
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 293 test cases, three of which fails CharacterReaderTest.handleCarriageReturnAsLineFeed(),
  CharacterReaderTest.consumeToEnd(), and ParserTest.handlesNewlinesAndWhitespaceInTag()
