previous commit 7d1723336c20ee0c31d0b4ed11a252c9e29abe97

Bug issue: 
Description: Fixed issue with selector parser where some boolean AND + OR combined queries 
(e.g. "meta[http-equiv], meta[content]") were being parsed incorrectly as OR only queries 
(e.g. former as "meta, [http-equiv], meta[content]")

Changes
- This version already contains the fault CE_1 in the file CombiningEvaluator, see CombiningEvaluator.cpp. The faulty line is 57.
- Wrong method calling.
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 245 test cases, one of which fails
