Bug issue: #
Description: Fixed CharacterReader to handle unconsuming at EOF correctly. Additional <script> test at EOF.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault CR_2 in the class CharacterReader, see CharacterReader.cpp. 
  The faulty lines are 32,33,34 in CharacterReader.
- The fault is a wrong assignment to a global variable. 
- 13182 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 284 test cases, with one failure at CharacterReader.unconsume(), 
  and one error at ParserTest.handlesUnclosedScriptAtEof().
