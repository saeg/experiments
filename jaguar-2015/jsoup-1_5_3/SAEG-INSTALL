Bug issue: #97
Description: Improved "abs:" absolute URL handling in Elements.attr("abs:href") and Node.hasAttr("abs:href").

Changes
- This version already contains the fault N_1 and N_2 in the file Node, see Node.cpp. 
  The faulty line are 73, and 106 to 111.
- There are two related faults: N_1 at line 73, there is a call to a wrong method. 
  N_2 at the lines 106 to 11 are new code (missing code). 
  The presence of both faults leads to 4 failures (the same test cases). N_2 is dominant: the 4 failures occur 
  independent of the presence of N_1. N_1 has 6 failures without N_2.
  The faults are related to the same fixing.n The results are similar for both faults.
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 269 test cases, four failures.
