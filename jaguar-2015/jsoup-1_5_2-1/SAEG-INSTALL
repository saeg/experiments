Bug issue: 
Description: Have <br> output as " " for Element.ownText()

Changes
- This version already contains the fault E_1 in the file Element, see Element.cpp. The faulty lines are 765,766,and 767.
- The is a missing code of a else if condition. The other changes in the method are just refactor.
- 8851 lines of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 250 test cases, one of which fails ElementTest.testBrHasSpace()
