For a quick start, you can use this snippet in your maven POM:

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>br.com.caelum</groupId>
	<artifactId>vraptor</artifactId>
	<version><%= Maven.vraptor_version %></version>
</dependency>
~~~

Or you can download it directly [at our artifacts repository](https://bintray.com/caelum/VRaptor4/br.com.caelum.vraptor/).

At the same repository you can download our sample project, the `vraptor-musicjungle`.

There is also the `vraptor-blank-project`, a base project configured with all required dependencies.
