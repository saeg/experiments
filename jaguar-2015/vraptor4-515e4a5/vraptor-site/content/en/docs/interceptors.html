#When intercept?

Interceptors are used to perform some task before or after a business logic like data validation, 
connection control, database transaction, logs and data encryption/compression.

##How to intercept?

VRaptor uses an approach where the interceptor defines who will be intercepted, more closer to the 
interception approaches used by <strong>AOP</strong> (Aspect Oriented Programming).

Therefore, to intercept a request, you need just to annotate the class with the `@Intercepts`. Like any 
other component, you can use scoped annotation to define the interceptor life cicle. The default scope 
for an interceptor is `RequestScoped`.

##A simple example

The class below shows an example how to intercept all requests in a request scoped and simply show 
the console output that is being invoked. Remember that the interceptor is a component like any 
other and can receive any dependencies using Dependency Injection.

~~~ 
#!java
@Intercepts
@RequestScoped
public class Log {

	@Inject
	private HttpServletRequest request;

	@AroundCall
	public void intercept(SimpleInterceptorStack stack) {
		System.out.println("Intercepting " + request.getRequestURI());
		// code to be executed before the stack

		stack.next(); // execute the stack
	}
}
~~~ 

To execute the code just before or after the controller execution, we can use annotations 
`@BeforeCall` and `@AfterCall`:

~~~ 
#!java
@Intercepts
@RequestScoped
public class Log {
	@BeforeCall
	public void before() {
		// code executed before
	}

	@AfterCall
	public void after() {
		// code executed after
	}
}
~~~ 

##Defining when intercepting

In the example above, all requests are intercepted. But we can define, as example, only methods 
annotated with `@Audit` annotation. You just to implement a method that returns a `boolean` with 
the necessary condition and annotate it with `@Accepts`.

~~~ 
#!java
@Accepts
public boolean accepts(ControllerMethod method) {
	return method.containsAnnotation(Audit.class);
}
~~~ 

Or we can use the more simple way. The example above is a very common case and thus often repeat 
this code. For this situation we can use the annotation `@AcceptsWithAnnotations` as described below:

~~~ 
#!java
@AcceptsWithAnnotations(Audit.class)
public class AuditInterceptor {
    
	@AroundCall
	public void around(SimpleInterceptorStack stack) {
		stack.next();
	}
}
~~~ 

##Customizing your Accepts

In the example above we used a customized accepts with annotation `AcceptsWithAnnotations`. And if you 
need, you can create your custom annotation to define when intercepts. Before you need to create your 
annotation like this example below.

~~~ 
#!java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@AcceptsConstraint(WithAnnotationAcceptor.class)
@Inherited
public @interface AcceptsWithAnnotations {
	public Class<? extends Annotation>[] value();
}
~~~ 

As you can see, we use the Annotation `@AcceptsConstraint` to define the class that have our logic. 
Now we need to implement this class.

~~~ 
#!java
public class WithAnnotationAcceptor implements AcceptsValidator<AcceptsWithAnnotations> {

	@Override
	public boolean validate(ControllerMethod controllerMethod, ControllerInstance instance) {
		//your code here
		return true;
	}

	@Override
	public void initialize(AcceptsWithAnnotations annotation) {
		//your code here
		this.allowedTypes = Arrays.asList(annotation.value());
	}
}
~~~ 

This class needs only to implements `AcceptsValidator<T>` interface, where generic `T` is the type 
of your custom annotation.

##How to guarantee the order: after and before

If you need to guarantee the execution order for your interceptors, you can use the `after` and 
`before` attributes from the `@Intercepts` annotation. Like the example below, if you have an 
interceptor named `FirstInterceptor` that needs to be executed before `SecondInterceptor`, you 
can declare like this:

~~~ 
#!java
@Intercepts(before=SecondInterceptor.class)
public class FirstInterceptor {
	...
}
~~~ 

and:

~~~ 
#!java
@Intercepts(after=FirstInterceptor.class)
public class SecondInterceptor {
	...
}
~~~ 

You can define one more Interceptor:

~~~ 
#!java
@Intercepts(after={FirstInterceptor.class, SecondInterceptor.class},
			before={FourthInterceptor.class, FifthInterceptor.class})
public class ThirdInterceptor {
	...
}
~~~ 

Note: VRaptor throws an exception if there is a cycle in the interceptors order. So be 
careful when you define interceptors order to avoid cicles.
