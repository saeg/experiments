# Working with CDI events

VRaptor now comes the main stream of the request using CDI events. The following image displays the triggered events and their observers:

## Events triggered by VRaptor

|VRaptorInitialized | triggered on application startup, indicating that VRaptor was initialized.
|RequestStarted | triggered the beginning of each request.
|RequestSucceeded | fired at the end of the request only if it has been processed without error.
|ControllerFound and ControllerNotFound | will indicate whether the Controller that answer the url was found or not.
|InterceptorsReady and InterceptorsExecuted | indicate when the stack will be executed and after its completion.
|MethodReady and MethodExecuted | when the controller method will run and after its completion.

## Observing VRaptor events

You can observe any event triggered by VRaptor. You just need create a method with the `@Observes` annotation under the package `javax.enterprise.event` before the event as a parameter. Something like:

~~~
#!java
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

import br.com.caelum.vraptor.events.ControllerNotFound;

public class MyObserver {
	
	public void method(@Observes ControllerNotFound event) {
		// execute an action here
	}
}
~~~

It's important to remember that there is no order in the observers execution, that means, there is no guarantee that a method will be executed before or after any other method that observes this same event. If the order is important, consider using interceptors.


## More about events

This cool feature helps you reduce the coupling of your code in an elegant manner. You can see more information about CDI events [in the CDI spec](http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/1.1/cdi-spec.html#_event_example).
