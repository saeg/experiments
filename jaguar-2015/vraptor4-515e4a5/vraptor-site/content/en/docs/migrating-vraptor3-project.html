title: Migrating from VRaptor 3

# Migrating from a VRaptor 3 project

##Java 7 and CDI 1.1

To use VRaptor you need a JDK 7 and an Application Server or Servlet Container that supports Servlets 3.1.


##IoC Containers

Now VRaptor uses CDI as container, so you don't need to use Guice, Pico or Spring.

CDI spec **requires** managed classes with normal scope to have a no-arg constructor. If you have another constructor annotated with `@Inject` you still need to add a no-arg constructor.

~~~
#!java
@Controller
public class MyController {

	private final MyComponent myComponent;

	/**
	 * @deprecated CDI eyes only
	 */
	protected MyComponent() {
		this(null);
	}

	@Inject
	public MyController(MyComponent myComponent) {
		this.myComponent = myComponent;
	}
}
~~~

### Static scanning

Since CDI can scan the classpath, this feature is not nedded anymore.


##Startup events

Now to trigger some code when VRaptor starts, you need to observe the event `VRaptorInitialized` as shown below:

~~~ 
#!java
@ApplicationScoped
public class PrintLog {

	@Inject
	private Logger logger;

	public void whenApplicationStarts(@Observes VRaptorInitialized initialized) {
		logger.info("My application is UP");
	}
}
~~~ 

##Changes in classes and method signatures

Some classes and methods were changed or removed. If you overrode some internal behaviour, you need to checkout our Javadocs to see what has changed.

All methods and classes annotated with `@Deprecated` were removed.

##OGNL

OGNL support was removed. Now we use IOGI to instantiate parameters, that supports immutable objects, `Set`s and more. 

##Validation

The fluent validation was removed. From now we only support Bean Validation. For legacy compatibility you can use `Validator.addIf(boolean, Message)` or `Validator.ensure(boolean, Message)` to do simple validation.

The `Validator` interface was moved to `br.com.caelum.vraptor.validator.Validator` package.

The classes that used to inherit from `Message` were changed. `ValidationMessage` was renamed to `SimpleMessage` and the constructor was refactored to `SimpleMessage(String category, String message, Object... params)` to keep it compatible with other `Message` implementations.

##Converters

All localized converters were merged with non-localized converters. From now on you don't need to declare these converters in the `web.xml`.

All converters were refactored, and `Converter#convert` doesn't have a `ResourceBundle` parameter anymore. If you need to use some localization features you can inject `Locale` in the class.

The `Converter` interface was moved to `br.com.caelum.vraptor.converter` package.

##VRaptor scopes removed

All VRaptor scopes are removed in favor of CDI scopes under package `javax.enterprise.context`:

~~~ 
#!java
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
@javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped
@javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped
@javax.enterprise.context.ConversationScoped
@javax.enterprise.context.Dependent
~~~ 


##Component factories

The `ComponentFactory` interface doesn't exist anymore. From now you can use `@Produces` from CDI spec. You can see more [here](/en/docs/components).

##Overriding components

Due to CDI behaviour you need to annotate your class with `@Specializes` annotation.

##@Resource is now @Controller

The `@Resource` annotation was renamed to `@Controller` and has the same behaviour.

##There is no Localization interface

Instead of using `Localization` and call `.getLocale()` or `.getBundle()` methods, from now on you can inject these objects directly like this:

~~~ 
#!java
public class MyClass {

	@Inject
	private Locale locale;

	@Inject
	private ResourceBundle bundle;

}
~~~ 

##LinkTo

The ***LinkTo*** feature was updated, and now support method sintax. From now on, instead of using `${linkTo[Controller].metodo[0, 1]}` you can use `${linkTo[Controller].metodo(0, 1)}`. More information [here](/en/docs/view-and-ajax).

To simplify migration, we shared a `.sh` script [here](https://gist.github.com/rponte/7546377).

##Serialization and deserialization

To stay closer with HTML5 spec, all date and time used with serialization and deserialization uses the ISO8601 format.

##Restfulie

It's not supported anymore.
