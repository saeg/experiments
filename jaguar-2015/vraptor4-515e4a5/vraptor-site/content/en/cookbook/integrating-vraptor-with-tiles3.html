# Integrating VRaptor with Tiles 3

## by Ot√°vio Garcia

Apache Tiles is a framework that implements the Composite View pattern, and makes possible to 
create templates for your application in easy way. You can found more information visiting 
<a href="http://tiles.apache.org">Tiles website</a>.

The first step is include the Tiles dependency in your Maven project as described below. 
If you don't uses Maven, you can download all files and its dependencies in 
<a href="http://tiles.apache.org">Tiles website</a>.

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.tiles</groupId>
	<artifactId>tiles-extras</artifactId>
	<version>3.0.0</version> <!-- or the latest version -->
</dependency>
~~~

And the next step is to add the listener that tells to Tiles when your application is up 
and ready.

~~~
#!xml
<listener>
    <listener-class>org.apache.tiles.extras.complete.CompleteAutoloadTilesListener</listener-class>
</listener>
~~~

And for the last step, you need to declare the `Servlet` that will respond Tiles requests. 
In the example below, any request to the URL `*.tiles` will be forwarded to Tiles templates.

~~~
#!xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>TilesDispatchServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.apache.tiles.web.util.TilesDispatchServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>TilesDispatchServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>*.tiles</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
~~~

And now we have Tiles listening requests.

By default, VRaptor does forwards to JSPs. So we need to override this behavior to forward 
to Tiles templates. We can do it changing the class `DefaultPathResolver` as described below.

~~~
#!java
@Specializes
public class TilesPathResolver extends DefaultPathResolver {

	@Inject
	protected TilesPathResolver(FormatResolver resolver) {
		super(resolver);
	}

	@Override
	protected String getPrefix() {
		return "/";
	}

	@Override
	protected String getExtension() {
		return "tiles";
	}
}
~~~

With this code, whether the request was initiated for method `CustomerController.form`, VRaptor 
will forward to template `customer.form`. So we only need by now to create the template 
definition in the file `/WEB-INF/tiles.xml`:

~~~
#!xml
<definition name="customer/form" template="/WEB-INF/jsp/layouts/basic.jsp">
	[...]
</definition>
~~~
