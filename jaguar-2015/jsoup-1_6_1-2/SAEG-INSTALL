Bug issue: #107
Description: Fixed issue where a single 0 character was lexed incorrectly as a null character.

Changes
- This version already contains the fault TBS_1 in the file TreeBuilderState, see TreeBuilderState.cpp. The faulty line is 1451.
- The fault is a wrong value passed to a method call of a Java default library in a static global variable. 
- Approximately 16K of Java code.
- The junit-4.5.jar was removed from the pom.xml and must be replaced by JUnit4

Installing
- import the project as an existing maven project. Use the file pom.xml
- ignore the maven-helper-maven-plugin error, it doesn't affect the program execution
- change the project's properties Java Compiler > Compiler compliance level to 1.7
- include JUnit library as JUnit4

- There is a total of 290 test cases, one of which fails, ParserTest.handles0CharacterAsText()
